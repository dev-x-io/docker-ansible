## Building the Image

Before you can run the container, you need to build the Docker image. Here's how:

```bash
docker build -t your-username/docker-ansible:latest .
```

Replace `your-username` with your DockerHub username or another name if you're not planning to push the image to DockerHub.

## Running the Container

To run the `docker-ansible` container:

```bash
docker run -it --name ansible_container your-username/docker-ansible:latest
```

## Binding Playbooks and SSH Keys

To make your local playbooks and SSH keys available inside the container:

1. **Bind your playbooks**:

   Append `-v /path/to/your/local/playbooks:/ansible/playbooks` to the `docker run` command.

   Example:

   ```bash
   docker run -it -v /path/to/your/local/playbooks:/ansible/playbooks --name ansible_container your-username/docker-ansible:latest
   ```

2. **Bind your SSH keys**:

   Append `-v /path/to/your/local/.ssh:/home/ansible/.ssh` to the `docker run` command.

   Example:

   ```bash
   docker run -it -v /path/to/your/local/.ssh:/home/ansible/.ssh --name ansible_container your-username/docker-ansible:latest
   ```

You can combine both bindings:

```bash
docker run -it -v /path/to/your/local/playbooks:/ansible/playbooks -v /path/to/your/local/.ssh:/home/ansible/.ssh/ --name ansible_container your-username/docker-ansible:latest
```

## Stopping the Container

To stop the `docker-ansible` container:

```bash
docker stop ansible_container
```

## Removing the Container

If you need to remove the container:

```bash
docker rm ansible_container
```
