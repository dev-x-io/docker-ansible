## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dev-x-io/docker-ansible.git
   cd docker-ansible
   ```

3. **Run the Container**:

## Usage

If you're new to Docker or need a refresher on how to use the `docker-ansible` container, we've got you covered! Check out our [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md) guide in the `docs/` directory. This document provides step-by-step instructions on building, running, and managing the Docker container, including how to bind your own playbooks and SSH keys.

If you have specific playbooks or configurations, place them in the respective folders as detailed in the directory structure.

Once the container is up and running, you can execute Ansible commands as you would in a typical environment. The provided `docker-compose.yml` ensures that your local Ansible directory is bound to the container, enabling real-time development and testing.
